# Avatar

The purpose of the `Avatar` component is to provide a wrapper around an image tag that fallbacks to a text when the image is broken or it can't be loaded for any reason.

## Structure

The rendering structure is composed by a `WrapperNode` which is the main element. As its `children` the component will render an `ImgNode` corresponding to the `img` along with a text provided by the `title` property and any possible children.

`ImgNode` will be rendered only when a image attribute is provided while `text` will be rendered either when the image fails or there is no image at all. The property `children` is always rendered.

```
  <WrapperNode>
    <ImgNode />
    {text}
    {children}
  </WrapperNode>
```
